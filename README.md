### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Md Shahed
#### I am FullStack Developer

Hi, My name is Md Shahed, A Friendly Full-Stack Developer and CSE Student!
Hey there! I'm Md Shahed, and I'm super excited to share a bit about myself with you.

1. I Love Building Websites!
What I Do: I'm a full-stack developer, which means I'm into both the fancy stuff you see on websites (like buttons and cool animations) and the behind-the-scenes magic that makes them work.
Tech Stuff: I'm really into tools like React for making things pretty, Node.js and Express.js for making them do cool stuff, and MongoDB for storing all the important bits of data.
2. Always Learning Something New
Student Life: Yep, I'm also a student studying Computer Science and Engineering at IIUC. Learning new things is my jam!
Problem-Solving: Whenever I face a tricky problem, I dive right in, trying out different solutions until I crack it.
3. Working Together is Awesome
Team Player: I believe in the power of teamwork. Git and GitHub are my buddies for keeping track of all the code changes when working with a team.
Let's Chat: Communication is key! Got questions or ideas? Reach out to me anytime.
4. Making Websites Look Good
Design Vibes: I'm not just about coding; I'm all about making websites look awesome too! Tailwind CSS is my go-to for styling websites and making them stand out.
5. Here to Help
Reach Out: Have a project in mind or just want to say hi? Hit me up on WhatsApp at +880 1540-362968. I'm here to make your web dreams come true!
